# stock-analysis

##Overview of Project
The purpose of the project is to prepare an analyzed dataset of his stock market over 2 years. 
Since way the code is designed in the green stocks file is not good to execute long and big data base, 
we came up to use refactor to shorten the time of the analyzation. This efficient coding will make Steveâ€™s dataset way faster than the previous one. 

## Result 

THe result of the analysis shows steve had way better outcome in 2017. 
These images show how much the stocks perfomed in both years.

Execution time reduced great amount by using refractor for the code. Here are the images of the timers;

These first two images indicate how much time it took for it to run the code without using the refractor

These two images show how much it takes to run the code with the refractor. 

These Diffrence will be greater if we have to analyze longer and more complicated datasets, which means it will be necessary to learn to design the codes
in more efficent ways.

These are some codes ran to get the results. 


## Summary

Adavange of refractoring the code, it can be easily added and get results in a very short time. It's quite tricky to set up the pipe-line, and it
should be tested more than the original VBA code, but at the end of the day, its way more efficent and modifiable.
